# `@mysten/walrus`

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save @mysten/walrus @mysten/sui
```

## Setup

To use the walrus SDK you will need to create an instance of the SuiClient from the typescript SDK,
and an instance of the walrus SDK.

```ts
import { getFullnodeUrl, SuiClient } from '@mysten/sui/client';
import { WalrusClient } from '@mysten/walrus';

const suiClient = new SuiClient({
	url: getFullnodeUrl('testnet'),
});

const walrusClient = new WalrusClient({
	network: 'testnet',
	suiClient,
});
```

The walrus SDK currently includes all the relevant package and object IDs needed for connecting to
testnet. You can also manually configure the walrusClient to use a different set of ids, allowing
you to connect to a different network or updated deployment of the walrus contracts.

```ts
const walrusClient = new WalrusClient({
	suiClient,
	packageConfig: {
		systemObjectId: '0x98ebc47370603fe81d9e15491b2f1443d619d1dab720d586e429ed233e1255c1',
		stakingPoolId: '0x20266a17b4f1a216727f3eef5772f8d486a9e3b5e319af80a5b75809c035561d',
	},
});
```

For some environments you may need to customize how data is fetched:

```ts
const walrusClient = new WalrusClient({
	network: 'testnet',
	suiClient,
	storageNodeClientOptions: {
		fetch: (url, options) => {
			console.log('fetching', url);
			return fetch(url, options);
		},
		timeout: 60_000,
	},
});
```

This can be used to implement a fetch function with custom timeouts, rate limits, retry logic, or
any other desired behavior.

## SDK Overview

The walrus SDK is designed primarily to be used to build aggregators and publishers, and may not be
optimal when used directly in client side apps. Reading and writing directly from storage nodes
requires a lot of requests (~2200 to write a blob, ~335 to read a blob). For most apps, using
aggregators and publishers with optimized reads/writes will provide a better user experience.

The `WalrusClient` exposes high level methods for reading and writing blobs, as well as lower level
methods for the individual steps in the process that can be used to implement more complex flows
when you want more control to implement more optimized implementations.

### Reading a blob

The `readBlob` method will read a blob given the `blobId` and return `Uint8Array` containing the
blobs content:

```ts
const blob = await walrusClient.readBlob({ blobId });
```

### Writing Blobs

Thw `writeBlob` method can be used to write a blob (as a `Uint8Array`) to walrus. You will need to
specify how long the blob should be stored for, and if the blob should be deletable.

You will also need to provide a `signer` instance that signs and pays for the transaction/storage
fees. The signer's address will need to have sufficient `SUI` to cover the transactions that
register the blob, and certify its availability after it's been uploaded. It will also need to own
sufficient `WAL` to pay to store the blob for the specified number of epochs, as well as the write
fee for writing the blob.

The exact costs will depend on the size of the blobs, as well as the current gas and storage prices.

```ts
const file = new TextEncoder().encode('Hello from the TS SDK!!!\n');

const { blobId } = await walrusClient.writeBlob({
	blob: file,
	deletable: false,
	epochs: 3,
	signer: keypair,
});
```

### Writing blobs with an upload relay

Writing blobs directly from a client requires a lot of requests to write data to all of the storage
nodes. An upload relay can be used to offload the work of these writes to a server, reducing
complexity for the client.

To use an upload relay, you can add the `uploadRelay` option when creating your `WalrusClient`:

```ts
const client = new SuiClient({
	url: getFullnodeUrl('testnet'),
	network: 'testnet',
}).$extend(
	WalrusClient.experimental_asClientExtension({
		uploadRelay: {
			host: 'https://upload-relay.testnet.walrus.space',
			sendTip: {
				max: 1_000,
			},
		},
	}),
);
```

The `host` option is required, and indicates the url for your upload relay. Upload relays may
require a tip to be included to cover the cost of writing the blob. You can configure a maximum tip
(paid in MIST) and the `WalrusClient` will automatically determine the required tip for your upload
relay, or you can manually configure the tip configuration as shown below.

The tip required by an upload relay can be found using the `tip-config` endpoint: (eg.
`https://upload-relay.testnet.walrus.space/v1/tip-config`) and may either be a `const` or a `linear`
tip.

### `const` tip

A `const` will send a fixed amount for each blob written to the upload relay.

```ts
const client = new SuiClient({
	url: getFullnodeUrl('testnet'),
	network: 'testnet',
}).$extend(
	WalrusClient.experimental_asClientExtension({
		uploadRelay: {
			host: 'https://upload-relay.testnet.walrus.space',
			sendTip: {
				address: '0x123...',
				kind: {
					const: 105,
				},
			},
		},
	}),
);
```

### `linear` tip

A `linear` tip will send a fixed amount for each blob written to the fan out proxy, plus a
multiplier based on the size of the blob.

```ts
const client = new SuiClient({
	url: getFullnodeUrl('testnet'),
	network: 'testnet',
}).$extend(
	WalrusClient.experimental_asClientExtension({
		uploadRelay: {
			host: 'https://upload-relay.testnet.walrus.space',
			sendTip: {
				address: '0x123...',
				kind: {
					linear: {
						base: 105,
						multiplier: 10,
					},
				},
			},
		},
	}),
);
```

### Full API

For a complete overview of the available methods on the `WalrusClient` you can reference type
[TypeDocs](http://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typedoc/classes/_mysten_walrus.WalrusClient.html)

### Examples

There are a number of simple
[examples you can reference](https://github.com/MystenLabs/ts-sdks/tree/main/packages/walrus/examples)
in the `ts-sdks` repo that show things like building simple aggregators and publishers with the
walrus SDK

## Error handling

The SDK exports all the error classes for different types of errors that can be thrown. Walrus is a
fault tolerant distributed system, where many types of errors can be recovered from. During epoch
changes there may be times when the data cached in the `WalrusClient` can become invalid. Errors
that result from this situation will extend the `RetryableWalrusClientError` class.

You can check for these errors, and reset the client before retrying:

```ts
import { RetryableWalrusClientError } from '@mysten/walrus';

if (error instanceof RetryableWalrusClientError) {
	walrusClient.reset();

	/* retry your operation */
}
```

`RetryableWalrusClientError` are not guaranteed to succeed after resetting the client and retrying,
but this pattern can be used to handle some edge cases.

High level methods like `readBlob` already handle various error cases and will automatically retry
when hitting these methods, as well as handling cases where only a subset of nodes need to respond
successfully to read or publish a blob.

When using the lower level methods to build your own read or publish flows, it is recommended to
understand the number of shards/sliver that need to be successfully written or read for you
operation to succeed, and gracefully handle cases where some nodes may be in a bad state.

### Network errors

Walrus is designed to be handle some nodes being down, and the SDK will only throw errors when it
can't read from or write to enough storage nodes. When trying to troubleshoot problems, it can be
challenging to figure out whats going wrong when you don't see all the individual network errors.

You can pass an `onError` option in the storageNodeClientOptions to get the individual errors from
failed requests:

```ts
const walrusClient = new WalrusClient({
	network: 'testnet',
	suiClient,
	storageNodeClientOptions: {
		onError: (error) => console.log(error),
	},
});
```

## Configuring network requests

Reading and writing blobs directly from storage nodes requires a lot of requests. The walrus SDK
will issue all requests needed to complete these operations, but does not handling all the
complexities a robust aggregator or publisher might encounter.

By default all requests are issued using the global `fetch` for whatever runtime the SDK is running
in.

This will not impose any limitations on concurrency, and will be subject to default timeouts and
behavior defined by your runtime. To customize how requests are made, you can provide a custom
`fetch` method:

```ts
import type { RequestInfo, RequestInit } from 'undici';
import { Agent, fetch, setGlobalDispatcher } from 'undici';

const walrusClient = new WalrusClient({
	network: 'testnet',
	suiClient,
	storageNodeClientOptions: {
		timeout: 60_000,
		fetch: (url, init) => {
			// Some casting may be required because undici types may not exactly match the @node/types types
			return fetch(url as RequestInfo, {
				...(init as RequestInit),
				dispatcher: new Agent({
					connectTimeout: 60_000,
				}),
			}) as unknown as Promise<Response>;
		},
	},
});
```

### Loading the wasm module in vite or client side apps

The walrus SDK requires wasm bindings to encode and decode blobs. When running in node or bun and
some bundlers this will work without any additional configuration.

In some cases you may need to manually specify where the SDK loads the wasm bindings from.

In vite you can get the url for the wasm bindings by importing the wasm file with a `?url` suffix,
and then passed into the walrus client:

```ts
import walrusWasmUrl from '@mysten/walrus-wasm/web/walrus_wasm_bg.wasm?url';

const walrusClient = new WalrusClient({
	network: 'testnet',
	suiClient,
	wasmUrl: walrusWasmUrl,
});
```

If you are unable to get a url for the wasm file in your bundler or build system, you can self host
the wasm bindings, or load them from a CDN:

```ts
const walrusClient = new WalrusClient({
	network: 'testnet',
	suiClient,
	wasmUrl: 'https://unpkg.com/@mysten/walrus-wasm@latest/web/walrus_wasm_bg.wasm',
});
```

In next.js when using walrus in API routes, you may need to tell next.js to skip bundling for the
walrus packages:

```ts
// next.config.ts
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
	serverExternalPackages: ['@mysten/walrus', '@mysten/walrus-wasm'],
};
```

### Known fetch limitations you might run into

- Some nodes can be slow to respond. When running in node, the default connectTimeout is 10 seconds
  and can cause request timeouts
- In `bun` the `abort` signal will stop requests from responding, but they still wait for completion
  before their promises reject
